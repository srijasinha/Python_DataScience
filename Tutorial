Python Libraries-
1)Python libraries are collections of pre-written codes to perform specific tasks. This eliminates the need of rewriting the code from scratch.
Uses of pthon library - a)Faster application development
                         b)Enhance code efficiency
                        c)Achieve code modularization

1.    Numpy

To get the mathematical and structural understanding of such data
To build a base for Pandas, the data manipulation library
To get familiar with terms like arrays, axis, vectorization etc.
 

2.       Pandas

To read the data
To explore the data
To do operations on the data
To manipulate the data
To draw simple visualizations for self-consumption
To generate insights
 

3.       Matplotlib

To visualize the data
To generate deep insights
To present the data to the leadership
To get a visual understanding of various features
 

4.       Sci-kit learn

To get data ready for model building
To build predictive models
To evaluate the models

A python List can be used to store a group of elements together in a sequence. It can contain heterogeneous elements.

Data structures in Numpy-
The main data structure of NumPy is the ndarray or n-dimensional array.

The ndarray is a multidimensional container of elements of the same type as depicted below. It can easily deal with matrix and vector operations.
